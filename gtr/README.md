An ancient project that I developed together with an old friend, Richard Schubert.
This is one of the first real programming projects we did and it taught us so
much. I just looked at the code (after about 12 years) and it's just hilarious
how bad it is!! VisualBasic 6 and DirectX7... Those where the days ;-)
